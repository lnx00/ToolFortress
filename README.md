# ToolFortress
ToolFortress is a collection of various tools to improve the Team Fortress 2 experience.
It contains various useful and fun features that work using TF2 RCON so it doesn't need any kind of injection.

## Download 
You can get the latest release of ToolFortress from the [releases page](https://github.com/lnx00/ToolFortress/releases)

## Features
Here's a list of most features that ToolFortress has:
- Kill and death messages (with many options)
- Automatic taunt kill
- Command spam (noisemaker or chat spam for example)
- CFG/Script loader
- Tools for AFK point farming (Teleporter farm)
- Automatic math solver (for community servers)
- In-Game overlay with playerlist and statistics
- Interactive playerlist
- Advaced game statistics (Enemy class, playtime, K/D)
- Integrated bot detector (Current broken)
- Online features to synchronise taunts and commands with your friends
- ...and even more!

## VAC Safety & How it works
ToolFortress is 100% VAC safe and can't get you banned. Just like [TF2 Bot Detector](https://github.com/PazerOP/tf2_bot_detector) it only uses official game commands and features to access the game. The communication with TF2 works by reading the console log file and sending commands to the game using RCON.
